Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Review the conceptual operation of a timer interrupt.

  a. For a 16-bit timer with clock frequency of 16MHz (like the Arduino) and
  prescalar of 64, how much time corresponds to a timer value of 2000?

  Time = Prescalar/Clock Frequency * Timer Value 
  Time = (64/16000000) * 2000
  Time = 0.0008 sec
  




  b. With a clock frequency of 16MHz and prescalar of 8, what is the longest
  amount of time we can track with an 8-bit hardware timer.

 Time = Prescalar/Clock Frequency * Max Timer Value 
 Time = 8 / 16000000 * (2^8 - 1) = 0.000128 seconds


2. (2 points) The Timer modules we have used also have the ability to make an
output pin turn ON (set), OFF (clear), or Toggle when the timer reaches the
OCR1A or OCR1B values (i.e. the hardware can automatically control the output
value of a pin). By searching the data sheet (ATmega328P datasheet is linked on
our website from the Tools and Links page) answer the following question:

   a.  TIMER1 (the 16-bit timer) can control the pins that are associated with
   OC1A and OC1B signals. Find to what pins these signals are wired by looking
   at Figure 1.1 ("28 PDIP" package diagram) on page 12 of the data sheet, or
   alternatively, Tables 14-3, 14-6, or 14-9.

    OC1A is wired to pin PB1 while OC1B is wired to pin PB2.



   b.  In this lab we use TIMER1 in the "Clear Timer on Compare" or CTC
   mode. In this mode when the counter reaches the value in OCR1A register it
   generates an interrupt and starts counting again from zero. Using the
   information in section 16.11.1 and table 16-1, describe what the OC1A and
   OC1B pins would do when the timer reaches the OCR1A value if during
   initialization we used the statement TCCR1A = 0x60;

   If we used the statement TCCR1A = 0x60, we are setting the fifth and sixth bits to 1 in binary,resulting in setting COM1A0 and COM1B1 to 1. 
   If this happens, then OC1A will be set in addition to OC1B.
