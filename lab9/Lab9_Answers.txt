Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 point) Tammy Trojan feels the gap between the MID brightness using a
37.5% PWM signal and the BRIGHT level at 100% is too much and wants to add a
fourth brightness level at 75% called "LIT".  In our circuit where a low signal
turns the LED on, this means she needs to create a signal that is low 75% of
the time, or a one 25% of the time. Assuming you had access to additional gates
to add to the circuit, how could you create this signal?  Write the Boolean
logic express for LIT in terms of the output signals from the counter.

D' * C'



2. (1 point) We would like to add a feature where if the Select button is
pressed on the LCD, it turns the LED off completely, and then turns it back on
when Select is pressed again.  Explain how this could be done without having to
make any changes to the wiring of the circuit .

Because there is still a fourth output in the 2-4 decoder that is left unused, we can 
utilize this instead of using a state variable. There should be a variable created that checks 
and keeps if the LED is turned on or off. In the case that this is the output that is selected, LED state 
variable will be switched.
