                          Lab 2 - Scopes and Signals

Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kHz", or "200 msec"

Note: Don't use special characters like Greek "mu" or "Omega" symbols in your
answers.  These don't display correctly on Vocareum and can make it hard to
grade the answers.  For example, if you need to specify units of microseconds,
just type "microseconds" or "usecs".


1. (5 points) Fill out the following table for outputs A0 and A1. The duty
cycle of a signal is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the time the
signal is in the high state to the period of the signal.

    Bit  Time in 1 state   Time in 0 state    Period    Frequency    Duty cycle

    A0        4.5 msec       2.5 msec          7 msec     142.86 Hz       0.64

    A1        0.9 msec       3.2 msec          4.1 msec    243.9 Hz       0.22


CHECKPOINT: Show a CP your measurements of the two periodic signals to
received the bonus points.

                          ---- Review Questions ----

1. (3 points) Suppose you wanted to measure the frequency of a note played by
a piano and sensed from a microphone connected/viewed on an oscilloscope.
Answer the following True/False questions with a brief explanation.

     a. True/False: To measure the frequency, the vertical scale of the
     oscilloscope would be of more use than the horizontal scale.
    
     False, the horizontal scale would be of much more use because it allows you to zoom in on the period 
     and count the number of waves in a period.

     b. True/False: Since the note is played for a short time period, we
     should set the triggering to "Single" rather than "Run".

     True, because "Single" would force the oscilloscope to stop measuring the instance the note is played. 
     This would be useful as in a short time period it would be hard to identify this moment, so having the 
     oscilloscope set to "Single" would allow for us to see only the important moment rather than the exercises
     information.

     c. True/False: If the signal ranges between 0V and 2.5V, the trigger
     level should ideally be set around 1.25V.

     False, because the trigger level indicates the level at which the oscilloscope should stop measuring 
     once reached. If the range is 0V to 2.5V, we will want the machine to measure until 2.5V not just 1.25V.


2. (2 points) Each scope probe has a short black ground wire attached to it.
Why is it necessary to connect this to the circuit's ground point in order to
make a measurement?

Ground is essentially a reference point, similar to "above sea level", when we measure voltage, it is in reference
to ground. This is why it is necesary to connect the probe to the circuit's ground to ensure that both have the 
same ground, or reference point.




3. (1 point) If you have used the Horizontal Position control to move the
trigger point horizontally so much that you can no longer see the trigger point
on the screen, what is the quick way to restore the trigger point back to the
middle of the screen?

If the horizontal position control is used to move the trigger point to the point to where it is not visible,
the quick way to restore it to the middle of the screen is by pressing the Horizontal Position control knob.
