		    Lab 7 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (2 points) TIMER1 is to be used to output a 50% duty cycle signal
(squarewave) for tone generation as was done in this lab.  For the two tones
specified below, determine a prescalar, the OCR1A value, and the number of
interrupts to allow before stopping the timer.  Your answer for the prescalar
and OCR1A values should be the ones that give the most accurate timing.

a. 200 Hz tone for 5 seconds
The prescalar is set to 1 and the OCR1A register is set to 400 Hz. The interrupts should be 1000.



b. 32 Hz tone for 2 seconds
The prescalar is set to 1 and the OCR1A is set to 64 Hz. The interrupts are 64.




2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.
It could lead to a intersection in the microcontroller when it is writing the command to LCD. The alternate
possibility is that even when the interrupts are disabled, the tone will end up playing.
