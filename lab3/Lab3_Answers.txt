		       Lab 3 - Arduino Input and Output

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit 2. 
Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

Response: The problem with this approach is that this assigns the value to the whole
register whereas we just want it to be assigned to bit 2. This will play
a role in the behavior of the buttons.


2. (2 points) Note that in Lab 2 we found that the delay of a NOT gate
(hardware only) is around 10ns and this measurement was very
consistent. However, the delay measured in this lab is on the order of 10
microseconds (hardware + software) and varies considerably from measurement to
measurement. Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple
measurements.

Hint: ignore the hardware propagation delays which are very small (tens of ns),
and think about how your program executes.

Response: The delay between the press of the 'C' button and the start of the LED sequence 
varied because the button was pressed at different moments throughout the while 
loop's run time.
